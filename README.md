MercAI is a fully custom-built miniature self-driving car designed from the ground up. It integrates hardware, PCB design, firmware development, and AI using OpenCV. The project aims to experience the challenge of building a self-driving vehicle, to put myself in Elon Musk's shoes. MercAI is inspired from my favourite car brand, Mercedes AMG.
